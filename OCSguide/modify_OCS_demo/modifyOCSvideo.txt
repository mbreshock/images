Modifying case study video outline: 

introduction: 
*on ocs webpage*
This video will show you how to modify an existing Open Case Study for your own specific needs. 

By the end of the demonstration, you will know how to: 
1. Find the case study GitHub repository 

2. Clone or fork the case study

3. Open the case study source files in RStudio

4. Modify the source files

5. Compile the modified case study


You can find the case study repository using the Open Case Study Search tool on our website.

Locate the case study you want to modify, and click on the repository link in the GitHub Repository column.

*on case study page*
You can also find a link to the repository in the case study itself.

*on github repository*
From here you can clone and fork the case study repository using git shell comands or the new OCSdata package. 
If you don't want the repository's version history, you may also use the package to download the case study 
as a Zip file. I will be using the Zip file method for this demonstration. 

*on RStudio*

```
show how to 
install.packages("OCSdata")
OCSdata::
```

- using pop up tooltips, show the clone_ocs function and how to fork briefly but dont run -

```
OCSdata::clone_ocs("ocs-bp-co2-emissions", outpath = getwd(), fork_repo = FALSE)
```

- show false to clone, true to fork, BUT DONT RUN - 

```
OCSdata::zip_ocs("ocs-bp-co2-emissions", outpath = getwd())
```

Once case study project opens automatically, open the index.Rmd file and scroll to the section you want to edit.

Modify the content as you wish, then click on the knit dropdown menu to select which format you want to compile your case study in. 
Open Case Studies uses HTML files to host the case studies online, but any of these formats can easily be distributed. 

Click knit

once is done knitting, RStudio will automatically render a preview of your case study. You can also see the compiled file in your working directory. 

That's all you have to do to modify a case study! thank you for watching.
